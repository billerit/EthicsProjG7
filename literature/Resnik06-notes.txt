Resnik 2006:
Some Recent Challenges to Openness and Freedom in Scientific
Publication
---------------------------------------------------------------

Private sector sponsors over 1/2 of R&D in the world.

Business money into science:
 + Benefitted researchers, universities, business and society
 - Openness and fairness in research

To industry, research is a necessary means to *PROFIT*. Openness and
freedom can be thrown out the window for the sake of profit.

Willard: Case example: Researcher hired by industry.

Scientist working at company:

  "Company will usually make him sign a contract in which he agrees
   that the company owns all of his data and has the authority to
   review and approve any of his publications."

Why would industry want to prevent researchers from publishing
results?

 1. IP. If the result (invention) is published, the idea is not novel
    anymore, so the industry cannot patent it.
 2. Maintain secrecy to secure competitive advantage / silence
    incriminating results.

Willard: Case: IP.
 * In many fields, distance from theory to product is great.
 * In computer science, the distance is 0.
 * This one thing a computer scientist can do, even in his spare time,
   is owned by the university.

Case: Tobacco industry. {DeNobel, Mele} working for Morris.
 * {DeNobel, Mele} discover that Nicotine is highly addivtive.
 * {DeNobel, Mele} discover a substance increasing addictiveness while
   making cigarettes healthier for blood vessels.
 * Were not allowed to discuss their results, until much later, when a
   congressman overruled the contract.

Case: Useless drugs. Dong, working for Boots.
 * Dong finds that Synthroid drug is less useful than general,
   main-stream drugs
 * US would save millions to just use the main-stream drugs.
 * Boots threatened to sue Dong, and spent 2 years discrediting the
   paper. Dong eventually pulled the paper from publication.

Case: Dangerous drug. Olivieri+ vs. ApotexInc.
 * Paper on "deferiprone", reporting that the drug was effective at
   reducing total body iron stores, with manageable side effects.
 * Months later, Olivieri+ discover liver iron in patients is
   dangerously high. Could lead to heart failure.
 * Olivieri wanted to notify the "research ethics board", so patients
   could learn about this. She did...
 * Consequence: ApotexInc terminated study, and withdrew all supplies
   of the drug. Threatened Olivieri+ legal actions if she told
   patients, or scientific community. ApotexInc + hospital tried to
   discredit her work, and ruin her carreer.

Morale?

  "universities should not allow their faculty to sign contracts that
   grant private companies the right to block the publication of
   research conducted on campus.  No private company should be able to
   suppress academic research."

[[Private industry and access to data from published research]]

Industry a threat to search for truth: Access to data after
publication.

Reasons scientists may refuse to share data:
 * protect unpublished work
 * secure priority
 * protect IP rights
 * data sharing inconvenient / expensive.
 * data is inconclusive / unconfirmed.

Case: Cold Fusion. {Pons, Fleischmann}

 * Believed they had discovered how to produce fusion at room
   temperature in an electrolytic solution.
 * Presented incomplete description of their method... at a press
   conference. B4 peer review.
 * Scientists were unable to replicate the result. 
 * Science community accused {Pons, Fleischmann} of fraud. Also angry
   since work was not peer-reviewed first.
 * Result: Public image of science reduced.

45% of surveyed journals do *not* have a data sharing policy.

Private companies sponsoring R&D expect a return for their
investment. If none arrives, they
 * stop sponsoring, or
 * use trade secrecy to protect data and results.
Neither of which are good for advancement of science.

Ways for private companies who invest in R&D to profit from
investment:
 * patenting new inventions
 * copyrighting original work
 * selling products and services

Celera sell their DNA data, and rights to search in it. Only
researchers use the data...

Should companies be allowed to profit from selling data? Industry
needs to be able to profit from their data, but researchers aren't
even allowed to search in it..

Analogy: In journals, you can read/search abstracts before paying for
the full paper. (two-tier system)

Perhaps this two-tier system also works for data.
 * raw data
 * analyzed data
First tier allows researchers to confirm published results, without
making researchers able to produce new research and innovations.
