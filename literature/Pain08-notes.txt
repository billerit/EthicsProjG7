Pain 2008:
Playing Well With Industry
--------------------------

Yamaha: Computers playing music like humans do.

[[Lure of industry money]]

Industry's goals: To profit.
 * Often align well with interests of researchers
 * ... but rarely perfectly.

More than 1/4 life science researchers have received support through
industry grant agreement and research contracts.

Government funding runs low; Deep pockets of private sector is
alluring.

Industry helps bring the result of science into the market (medicine).

But Industry's *PROFIT* motive can affect research.
 * Tobacco industry funding biased research to improve public image.
 * Oil/Gas companies have too much control over
    - choice of on-campus research
    - Intellectual Property rights,
    - Power to review/delay publications.
 * Research cannot disfavour the company funding it.
 * Cannot share the data.
 * Sweep negative results under the rug (drug has bad effects => don't
   publish it)

Some of these exist within research institutions anyways, though.

[[Industry gifts: A free lunch?]]

Gifts of equipment/fellowship/grant from industry with few strings
attached is common in the research world.

Often, however, there are strings. Sometimes they are not even written
into the contracts.

almost 1/2 life science researchers have received gifts from
industry. Here are some strings:
 * Only use gifts for what company allows.
 * Test company products.
 * Company reviews papers before publication.
 * Company owns patentable results.

It is in the researcher's interest to please the company.

Industry checks on progress regularly.

... but so does the government.

[[Strings]]

Hazardous way to get company money: Work on projects of mutual
interest. You WILL have to trade away some freedom.
 * for instance, data- and result-reporting.

What compromises are okay?

  "Accepting industry money is fine as long as academics don't
   compromise the academic missions of their universities"

Tipping point: When cooperation with industry compromises:

  "promote the public good through training students and pursuing
   research on important issues"

Examples:
 * Delay a student's progress towards a degree
 * Focus from broad questions to focused questions of little interest
   to almost anyone except your company

One of most quarrelsome issues: IP (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY). Willard
agrees.

Willard: Aalborg University can claim ownership of *anything* that you
do when you are employed there. Granted, the policy is that they
choose not to if you open-source your work, but still.

What most big-heads agree on: Universities keep IP rights, Industry is
allowed to commercialize innovations.

Right of first refusal: If you give it to A, then if you wish to sell
your idea, you must first ask A if they plan on profiting on
it. Universities often give this to companies.
