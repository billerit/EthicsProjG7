The Intellectual Property Pie
-----------------------------

Main questions in this short article:
 a) What can be protected by IP law?
 b) Who gets the IP rights?

Regarding a): Consider the following:
 1) Ideas (in your head or on paper) 
 2) "Original, tangible expression and useful invention".

The latter can be protected by IP law. The former cannot. Example: If
someone steals your idea for a paper, no law is broken. If someone
plagiarizes some of your text, that someone has stolen from you.

GRAYNESS: The space between 1) and 2).

Regarding b): The devil's contract (work-for-hire doctrine):

  Employers own the intellectual property rights to works created by
  the employees acting within the scope of their employment.

GRAYNESS: The scope of your employment:
 * How close is your idea to the work you are paid to do?
 * Is your employee a university, and are you also a student there?

When sponsors are involved, the sponsors might require that they own
the IP (which the university would otherwise have) related to the
project at hand (see GRAYNESS just above).

Author's suggestion:
 * Know your rights.
 * Avoid contracts which
    * delay publication time
    * reserve final editorial discretion
 * Ex: Ask if you can
    * use your work in your teaching,
    * distribute your work at scolarly conferences,
    * post it on the web at some point,
    * create derivative work from it.
 * REQUIRE professional credit for your work.
