Taborsky
--------

See ../ip/ip-thepie-notes.txt

Some facts:

 * Taborsky was a student.
 * Taborsky was also an employee.
 * Taborsky was funded by project grant from "Florida Progress".
 * During which time no results turned up.
 * Taborsky was then funded by other budgets.
 * During which time Taborsky made a discovery.
 * "Florida Progress" lays claim.

Willard's observations:

 * He made the discovery "after hours". He was not working, so he
   could argue that the "work-for-hire" docrine does not apply to
   him.
 * Depends on how the "Florida Progress" contract was stated. What did
   it say about derivative work?
 * Taborsky was threatened: "Give us your IP, or go to prison". He
   refused. What happened to the IP? Does he still have it? (in which
   case, he has millions waiting for him when he gets out of jail)
