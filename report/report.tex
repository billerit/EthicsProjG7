\willard{We need to include mini-summaries of cases and examples
  supporting the claims we make here. We also need to elaborate more
  on ``lessons learned''. Most importantly, we must explain how IP
  plays a key role here!}
\begin{itemize}
\item Universities: Institutes for unbiased critical thinking. Goal:
  Advance society, improve quality of life.
\item Industry: Business enterprise. Goal: Profit.
\item Industry is funding research in universities. Increasingly. Which would be great, except\ldots{}
\item Problems (some horror stories):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Industry tailors test results to their favour.
  \item Industry blocks publications which discredit their work / hurt their industry.
  \item Industry influences education.
  \end{itemize}
\item Benefits (industry money is not all bad):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Industry helps bring the results of science into the market.
  \item Industry funds research.
  \item Industry (for its own selfish reasons) is helping improve our quality of life.
  \end{itemize}
\item Industry wants our innovations, we want their money. \textbf{If
    reins are let go}, industry assimilates universities (consequences
  of that: university becomes a business, people loose trust in it,
  \ldots{}). How much do we let the universities get away with? How do
  we prevent assimilation?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Make sure to be funded from multiple independent partners.
  \item If you must invite industry into the university board, make
    sure they are a minority, and no single industry dominates.
  \item Laws on the following should be past: University research should be independent of individual
    company needs (make law)
  \item A collective guidelines for cooperation with industry must
    be made.
  \item See \cite{pain2008}, section ``strings''.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
