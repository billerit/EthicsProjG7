Case: Novartis/Berkeley
* Industry assimilates university.
* Solution:
   - a clever contract
   - funding from multiple partners (Charmec)

Case: Industry in chairs
* Industry influences education/training
* Solution:
   - non-domination. Committee as a whole not 
     dominated by 1 company or industry

General solution:
* University research should be independent of individual company
  needs (make law)
* Industry, with "unlimited funding" + legal actions, has too much
  power. This has to stop.
