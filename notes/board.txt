Case: Novartis/Berkeley
* Industry assimilates university.
* Solution:
   - a clever contract
   - funding from multiple partners (Charmec)

Case: Industry in chairs
* Industry influences education/training
* Solution:
   - non-domination. Committee as a whole not 
     dominated by 1 company or industry

General problems:
* Industry, with "unlimited funding" + legal actions, has too much
  power. This has to stop.
* University starts lookign like an enterprise.
   - Technology-licencing results; belongs to university (who are
     beginning to belong to industry).
* Industry hides flaws, making results look nicer. This is embarassing
  for the University.

* Industry's prime motivator: Profit. This affects university people
  working for industry: 
   - publication bias
   - ghostwriting
   - study-design bias (scenario favourable to company)

General solution:
* University research should be independent of individual company
  needs (make law)
* Collective guidelines for cooperation with industry.

Focus of report: Intellectual Property.


Case: The Master Student.
-------------------------

Stakeholders:
 * Petr Taborsky
 * University/Professor
 * Company

Let {University, Company} = Godzilla.

Facts:
 * Taborsky working on company-sponsored research
   project. (Godzilla)
 * Project: Remove ammonia from wastewater.
 * Taborsky received (word-of-mouth) permission
   from professor to pursue his own research 
   approach.
 * Taborsky discovers commercially promising way to
   remove ammonia from wastewater.
 * Godzille lays claim to Taborsky's work.
 * Godzilla takes legal action (> 10*normal fee spent)
 * Taborsky convicted of stealing university property.
 * Taborsky sent to maximum security prison.
 * Media gets aware of this.
 * Governor Lawton Chiles intervenes, offering clemency.
 * Taborsky refuses.

Uncertainties:
 * How did Taborsky receive the permission? (unclear)
    - Word-of-mouth (trust-based)
    - Contract

Missing information:
 * Witnesses
 * How new is Taborsky's idea?

Points of conflict:
 * Taborsky's idea + profit
 * Godzilla's profit

Ethical issues:
 * IP.
 * Trust-based word-of-mount contract. (one would think that this
   would be sufficient in a university. But it is not). For some
   reason, university is more interested in money that scientific
   progress.

Values at stake:
 * Taborsky's carreer
 * Financial health of Taborsky
 * Financial health of Godzilla

Taborsky's ethical obligation to Godzilla:
 * If idea belonged in part to Godzilla, they deserve piece of the
   pie.
 * see TODO.

Options:
 * see TODO


TODO:
-----
 * Find options to solving this ethical problem.
    - where should the decision be taken.
      (too late when Godzilla gets wind of Taborsky's idea)
 * Find analogous cases: IP issues in university.
 * Create different scenarios.
 * Find professional code of ethics for this case.
 * Summarize / Expand "lessons learned" from papers.
