Case: Novartis/Berkeley
* Industry assimilates university.
* Solution:
   - a clever contract
   - funding from multiple partners (Charmec)

Case: Industry in chairs
* Industry influences education/training
* Solution:
   - non-domination. Committee as a whole not 
     dominated by 1 company or industry

General problems:
* Industry, with "unlimited funding" + legal actions, has too much
  power. This has to stop.
* University starts lookign like an enterprise.
   - Technology-licencing results; belongs to university (who are
     beginning to belong to industry).
* Industry hides flaws, making results look nicer. This is embarassing
  for the University.

* Industry's prime motivator: Profit. This affects university people
  working for industry: 
   - publication bias
   - ghostwriting
   - study-design bias (scenario favourable to company)

General solution:
* University research should be independent of individual company
  needs (make law)
* Collective guidelines for cooperation with industry.

Focus of report: Intellectual Property.


Case: The Master Student.
-------------------------

Stakeholders:
 * Petr Taborsky
 * University/Professor
 * Company

Let {University, Company} = Godzilla.

Facts:
 * Taborsky working on company-sponsored research
   project. (Godzilla)
 * Project: Remove ammonia from wastewater.
 * Taborsky received (word-of-mouth) permission
   from professor to pursue his own research 
   approach.
 * Taborsky discovers commercially promising way to
   remove ammonia from wastewater.
 * Godzille lays claim to Taborsky's work.
 * Godzilla takes legal action (> 10*normal fee spent)
 * Taborsky convicted of stealing university property.
 * Taborsky sent to maximum security prison.
 * Media gets aware of this.
 * Governor Lawton Chiles intervenes, offering clemency.
 * Taborsky refuses.

Uncertainties:
 * How did Taborsky receive the permission? (unclear)
    - Word-of-mouth (trust-based)
    - Contract

Missing information:
 * Witnesses
 * How new is Taborsky's idea?

Points of conflict:
 * Taborsky's idea + profit
 * Godzilla's profit

Ethical issues:
 * IP.
 * Trust-based word-of-mount contract. (one would think that this
   would be sufficient in a university. But it is not). For some
   reason, university is more interested in money that scientific
   progress.

Values at stake:
 * Taborsky's carreer
 * Financial health of Taborsky
 * Financial health of Godzilla

Taborsky's ethical obligation to Godzilla:
 * If idea belonged in part to Godzilla, they deserve piece of the
   pie.
 * see TODO.

Options:
 * see TODO

Taborsky's ethical obligation to Godzilla:
The information is not clear on whether Taborsky was using his part time to continue the research. 
However, the university or lab has given him enough support to let him continue his research and get some result. The university deserves a piece of pie. 
Options and consequences :  
As Dan Fisher(Chair of IEEE-USA IP committee) said, universities have to be clear with student employees about whether they are hired to invent or not and should include notices in
catalogs and other obvious places that tell students where they can view a copy of the university policies. However, it's ambiguous all over the country.  
The reason to have the IP policy is to let the university or company have flexibility to interpret it in their way.
 
Option1:
Taborsky’s option:
The thing he did at the first place is to talk to Florida Progress representative and his professor. Why didn’t him consult with university patent office. 
There is a gray area in the law. He should look careful at the university policy of IP before he released his news of awesome discovery. If the policy is not fair to him, he could postpone it after he graduated.  
Consequence : 
He could face the risk that someone is doing the same thing and apply patent before he has the opportunity. 
The Godzille can still sue him, but they have very little proof to win the trial.
Option 2: To essentially solve the problem is to change the system and the policy. It’s clearly the Florida progress has significant influence in USF, such that the professor and USF board need to do something to reassure the company. That leads to our case 1 solution, the university should get funding from multiple sources instead of keeping close relation with one. 
Assessment &  Action 
Option1
By all means of test, publicity, reversibility, etc. the action cannot satisfy everyone except the individual. However, there is no fair policy, why should people follow.  
Option2 
In every perspective, this is the best way. Except the Florida progress won’t be satisfied. The university is a public resources, it should keep it supreme dominate position in front of the industrial partner. 


TODO:
-----
 * Find options to solving this ethical problem.
    - where should the decision be taken.
      (too late when Godzilla gets wind of Taborsky's idea)
 * Find analogous cases: IP issues in university.
 * Create different scenarios.
 * Find professional code of ethics for this case.
 * Summarize / Expand "lessons learned" from papers.
