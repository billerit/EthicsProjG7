For today,

 * Read the papers,
    - Important points,
    - Surprise
    - Problems
    - Ideas

 * Describe "lessons learned",
    - some of the most important/interesting points 
      from the articles/discussion
    - support them with examples/experiences
    - will be presented to class.

 * Prepare for analysis of "the case":
    - Select one from the papers.
    - Group selects one to analyze.

 * Consider 1-2 questions to class.
    - The questions should spark discussion.

The report, which we will present to class, will contain

 * Lessons Learned,
 * Analysis of the chosen case,
 * 1-2 Questions to spark discussion.


Pain 2008:
Playing Well With Industry
--------------------------

Yamaha: Computers playing music like humans do.

[[Lure of industry money]]

Industry's goals: To profit.
 * Often align well with interests of researchers
 * ... but rarely perfectly.

More than 1/4 life science researchers have received support through
industry grant agreement and research contracts.

Government funding runs low; Deep pockets of private sector is
alluring.

Industry helps bring the result of science into the market (medicine).

But Industry's *PROFIT* motive can affect research.
 * Tobacco industry funding biased research to improve public image.
 * Oil/Gas companies have too much control over
    - choice of on-campus research
    - Intellectual Property rights,
    - Power to review/delay publications.
 * Research cannot disfavour the company funding it.
 * Cannot share the data.
 * Sweep negative results under the rug (drug has bad effects => don't
   publish it)

Some of these exist within research institutions anyways, though.

[[Industry gifts: A free lunch?]]

Gifts of equipment/fellowship/grant from industry with few strings
attached is common in the research world.

Often, however, there are strings. Sometimes they are not even written
into the contracts.

almost 1/2 life science researchers have received gifts from
industry. Here are some strings:
 * Only use gifts for what company allows.
 * Test company products.
 * Company reviews papers before publication.
 * Company owns patentable results.

It is in the researcher's interest to please the company.

Industry checks on progress regularly.

... but so does the government.

[[Strings]]

Hazardous way to get company money: Work on projects of mutual
interest. You WILL have to trade away some freedom.
 * for instance, data- and result-reporting.

What compromises are okay?

  "Accepting industry money is fine as long as academics don't
   compromise the academic missions of their universities"

Tipping point: When cooperation with industry compromises:

  "promote the public good through training students and pursuing
   research on important issues"

Examples:
 * Delay a student's progress towards a degree
 * Focus from broad questions to focused questions of little interest
   to almost anyone except your company

One of most quarrelsome issues: IP (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY). Willard
agrees.

Willard: Aalborg University can claim ownership of *anything* that you
do when you are employed there. Granted, the policy is that they
choose not to if you open-source your work, but still.

What most big-heads agree on: Universities keep IP rights, Industry is
allowed to commercialize innovations.

Right of first refusal: If you give it to A, then if you wish to sell
your idea, you must first ask A if they plan on profiting on
it. Universities often give this to companies.



Resnik 2006:
Some Recent Challenges to Openness and Freedom in Scientific
Publication
---------------------------------------------------------------

Private sector sponsors over 1/2 of R&D in the world.

Business money into science:
 + Benefitted researchers, universities, business and society
 - Openness and fairness in research

To industry, research is a necessary means to *PROFIT*. Openness and
freedom can be thrown out the window for the sake of profit.

Willard: Case example: Researcher hired by industry.

Scientist working at company:

  "Company will usually make him sign a contract in which he agrees
   that the company owns all of his data and has the authority to
   review and approve any of his publications."

Why would industry want to prevent researchers from publishing
results?

 1. IP. If the result (invention) is published, the idea is not novel
    anymore, so the industry cannot patent it.
 2. Maintain secrecy to secure competitive advantage / silence
    incriminating results.

Willard: Case: IP.
 * In many fields, distance from theory to product is great.
 * In computer science, the distance is 0.
 * This one thing a computer scientist can do, even in his spare time,
   is owned by the university.

Case: Tobacco industry. {DeNobel, Mele} working for Morris.
 * {DeNobel, Mele} discover that Nicotine is highly addivtive.
 * {DeNobel, Mele} discover a substance increasing addictiveness while
   making cigarettes healthier for blood vessels.
 * Were not allowed to discuss their results, until much later, when a
   congressman overruled the contract.

Case: Useless drugs. Dong, working for Boots.
 * Dong finds that Synthroid drug is less useful than general,
   main-stream drugs
 * US would save millions to just use the main-stream drugs.
 * Boots threatened to sue Dong, and spent 2 years discrediting the
   paper. Dong eventually pulled the paper from publication.

Case: Dangerous drug. Olivieri+ vs. ApotexInc.
 * Paper on "deferiprone", reporting that the drug was effective at
   reducing total body iron stores, with manageable side effects.
 * Months later, Olivieri+ discover liver iron in patients is
   dangerously high. Could lead to heart failure.
 * Olivieri wanted to notify the "research ethics board", so patients
   could learn about this. She did...
 * Consequence: ApotexInc terminated study, and withdrew all supplies
   of the drug. Threatened Olivieri+ legal actions if she told
   patients, or scientific community. ApotexInc + hospital tried to
   discredit her work, and ruin her carreer.

Morale?

  "universities should not allow their faculty to sign contracts that
   grant private companies the right to block the publication of
   research conducted on campus.  No private company should be able to
   suppress academic research."

[[Private industry and access to data from published research]]

Industry a threat to search for truth: Access to data after
publication.

Reasons scientists may refuse to share data:
 * protect unpublished work
 * secure priority
 * protect IP rights
 * data sharing inconvenient / expensive.
 * data is inconclusive / unconfirmed.

Case: Cold Fusion. {Pons, Fleischmann}

 * Believed they had discovered how to produce fusion at room
   temperature in an electrolytic solution.
 * Presented incomplete description of their method... at a press
   conference. B4 peer review.
 * Scientists were unable to replicate the result. 
 * Science community accused {Pons, Fleischmann} of fraud. Also angry
   since work was not peer-reviewed first.
 * Result: Public image of science reduced.

45% of surveyed journals do *not* have a data sharing policy.

Private companies sponsoring R&D expect a return for their
investment. If none arrives, they
 * stop sponsoring, or
 * use trade secrecy to protect data and results.
Neither of which are good for advancement of science.

Ways for private companies who invest in R&D to profit from
investment:
 * patenting new inventions
 * copyrighting original work
 * selling products and services

Celera sell their DNA data, and rights to search in it. Only
researchers use the data...

Should companies be allowed to profit from selling data? Industry
needs to be able to profit from their data, but researchers aren't
even allowed to search in it..

Analogy: In journals, you can read/search abstracts before paying for
the full paper. (two-tier system)

Perhaps this two-tier system also works for data.
 * raw data
 * analyzed data
First tier allows researchers to confirm published results, without
making researchers able to produce new research and innovations.
