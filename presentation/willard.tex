\subsection{What \& Why}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What is IP?}
  Define.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Patent
  \item Copyright
  \item Trade Secret
  \end{itemize}
  Ownership of creative work is central in Industry-University research ethics.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Our Proposal}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{An Ideal IP rule?}
  \begin{enumerate}[1.]
  \item Industry can only demand a \emph{patent} on discoveries:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Strictly within the scope of the funded project,
    \item Only for the duration of the project, and
    \item Only if industry plans to profit from discovery.
    \end{itemize}    
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Shortcomings}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Works for Engineering, but\ldots{}}
  Some problems.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Industry must trust university to deliver discoveries to industry.
  \item Patent time must differ from field to field.
  \item Some discoveries are inherently unpatentable.
  \end{itemize}
